===Install===
Plce files on your webserver. Requires PHP.

Create an empty MySQL database using
iati-stats.sql

==To get data==
I need to add import scripts and links to CSV files to import from. 
In the meantime I can supply data if you ask me. See Copying/Licence.txt for details.

===Database notes===
I think the tests table will have been built from Bill's spreadsheet
I think the providers table would have been a csv import but can't find an original csv!
Hierarchy is 0 for all at the moment
